## WorkFlow

- For the initial launch of the application, the data is fetched from the Nasa API using Retrofit.
- This data is stored in the Room Database for future reference.
- This information will be used when the user relaunches the application.
- If the application is launched for the same date then the information from the database will be used, else it will be again fetched from the Nasa API.
- During the fetching stage of the application, whether from the database or server loading screen will be displayed.
- Any error encountered will be notified and an error screen will be displayed.
- User and retry the operation using the error button displayed on the error screen
